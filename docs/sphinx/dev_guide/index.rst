RAJA Performance Suite Developer Guide
########################################

The RAJA Performance Suite project follows nearly identical development 
processes as RAJA, which are documented in the 
`RAJA Developer Guide <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/dev_guide/index.html>`_ 

This guide is structured similarly to the RAJA Developer Guide and refers to 
sections in that on various development topics to avoid redundancy. It does 
contains information about differences in development and maintenance 
practices that are specific to the RAJA Performance Suite.

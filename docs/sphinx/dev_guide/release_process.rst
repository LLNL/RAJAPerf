************************************************************
RAJA Performance Suite Release Process
************************************************************

The RAJA Performance Suite project uses the same release process as RAJA
project and RAJA Performance Suite releases are part of the coordinated 
release process for other **RAJA Portability Suite** projects. Specifically, 
when new releases of those projects are done, a release of the RAJA 
Performance Suite follows soon after. Please see `RAJA Portability Suite Releases <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/dev_guide/release_process.html>`_ for more information.

The version naming scheme for the RAJA Performance Suite is also the same
as for RAJA Portability Suite projects. Please see `RAJA Release Version Naming <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/dev_guide/versioning.html>`_ for details.

********************************************
Contributing to the RAJA Performance Suite
********************************************

Like RAJA, the RAJA Performance Suite is a collaborative open-source software 
project. We encourage contributions from anyone who wants to add features 
or improve RAJA Performance Suite capabilities. Contributors should be familiar
with `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, which is the tool we use for source code 
version control, and `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, which is where the 
project is hosted. 

Access to the RAJA Performance Suite GitHub project and acceptance of 
contributions to it are managed identically to the RAJA project. In the 
RAJA Developer Guide, you will find information on accessing the RAJA GitHub 
project, restrictions on a fork of the repository, contributions and pull 
requests. Please follow the RAJA processes for contributions to the 
RAJA Performance Suite. Please see `Contributing to RAJA <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/dev_guide/contributing.html>`_ for details.

The most important things to know about making a contribution to the 
RAJA Performance Suite involve the organization of the source code and
how it works, especially when adding a new Kernel or Variant. These items
are described in detail in :ref:`structure-label`.

RAJA Performance Suite User Guide
###################################

If you have some familiarity with RAJA and want to get up and running with 
the RAJA Performance Suite quickly, check out :ref:`build-label` and 
:ref:`run-label` which contain information about getting the code, building 
it, and running it.

If you want to learn more about RAJA, please see the 
`RAJA User Guide <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/user_guide/index.html>`_, which contains a detailed discussion of RAJA features and a RAJA 
tutorial, both of which contain code examples.

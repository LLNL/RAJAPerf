RAJA Performance Suite
########################

=============================
Motivation and Background
=============================

The RAJA Performance Suite is designed to explore performance of loop-based
computational kernels found in HPC applications. Specifically, it is
used to assess and monitor runtime performance of kernels implemented using
`RAJA C++ performance portability abstractions <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA>`_.
The Suite contains a variety of kernels implemented using common parallel 
programming models, such as OpenMP and CUDA. Some important 
terminology used in the Suite implementation and discussion includes:

  * **Kernel** is a distinct loop-based computation that appears in the Suite in
    multiple variants (or implementations), each of which performs the same
    computation.
  * **Group** is a subset of kernels in the Suite that originated from the 
    same source, such as a specific benchmark suite.
  * **Variant** refers to implementations of Suite kernels that share the same 
    implementation approach and programming model, such as *baseline OpenMP*, 
    *RAJA OpenMP*, etc.
  * **Tuning** refers to execution of kernels with a particular execution
    parameterization, such as GPU thread-block size 128, 256, etc.

The kernels in the Suite originate from various HPC benchmark suites and 
applications. For example, the "Stream" group contains kernels from the Babel 
Stream benchmark, the "Apps" group contains kernels extracted from
real scientific computing applications, and so forth. Each kernel in the Suite 
appears in multiple RAJA and non-RAJA (i.e., *baseline*) variants that use 
parallel programming models supported by RAJA. Some kernels support multiple 
tunings of a variant to explore the performance implications of options that 
a programming model supports.

.. note:: A kernel does not need to provide all possible variants in the 
          Suite. Tyoically, each kernel provides only the subset of variants
          that makes sense for the kernel.

The Suite can be run as a single process or with multiple processes when
configured with MPI support. When running with multiple MPI processes, the same 
code is executed on each rank. Ranks are synchronized before and after each
kernel executes to gather timing data to rank zero. Running with multiple 
MPI processes helps the Suite generate performance data that is more 
realistic for HPC applications than performance data generated running with 
a single process. For example, running sequentially with one MPI 
rank per core vs running sequentially with a single process yields different 
performance results on most multi-core CPUs because bandwidth resources are
exercised differently. Similarly, for GPU systems where multiple MPI ranks
are necessary to fully utilize GPU compute resources.

More information about running the Suite for different types of performance 
studies is provided in the

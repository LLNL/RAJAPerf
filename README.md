RAJA Performance Suite
======================

[![Azure Piepline Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/llnl/RAJAPerf/_apis/build/status/LLNL.RAJAPerf?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/llnl/RAJAPerf/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rajaperf/badge/?version=develop)](https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/?badge=develop)

The RAJA Performance Suite is a companion project to the [RAJA] C++ performance
portability abstraction library. The Performance Suite designed to explore
performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications.
Specifically, it is used to assess and monitor run time performance of kernels 
implemented using [RAJA] compare those to variants implemented using common 
parallel programming models, such as OpenMP and CUDA, directly.
